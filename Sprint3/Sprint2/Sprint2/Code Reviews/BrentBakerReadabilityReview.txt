This class is easy to read and maintain as it is a class that just hold the constants for rectangles. The comments detail
what rectangles are being discribed and and are split up by what they are. The constants can be changed in this file if a 
sprite were to change and the correction would only need to be changed here. The constants are nicely names as their name
contains the item and weather its the x, y, width or highth its describing.
