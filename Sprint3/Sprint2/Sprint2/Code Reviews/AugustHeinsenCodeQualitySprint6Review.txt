The jump is appropriately drawn, and additionally easy to read. Everything is named the way that we would expect,
and along with concise method implementations where it was easy for me to decide if we needed changes to the following
implementation that we currently have. If in the future in a few months I was to look at this class again, the naming
convention is easy enough to follow what is going on. Shooting is clearly shown in the class as well.
