For sprint 6 RectangleConstants is a quick and easy to read and modify file. Its set up to store all the coRectangles that are
used in all the other classed that use rectangles to get a sprite off a sprite sheet. If the sprite sheet where to change or use
a new sprite sheet you would just change the rectangle constants here and the other classes would not need to be changed. More constants
will need to be added as new items, blocks, enemies, charaters are added.
